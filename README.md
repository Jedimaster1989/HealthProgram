``````

HEIGTH=177
WEIGTH=90
GENDER=male

- In order to lose xxx Kg per week you need to consume xxxx Kcal per day mantaining your level of activity!

# Conteinarized application

To make it simpler to use the app without having to clone the entire repository to your computer, I've created a Docker image for it. You can pull the image from a Docker Hub repository using the following link:
``````
docker pull jedifmaster/calories-measure:v1
``````

You only need to create a file with the variables, for example, env-file.txt, and write the necessary variables in there, as shown in the example above.
And then start the container with the command:
``````
docker run --rm --env-file <path-to-the-env-file.txt> jedifmaster/calories-measure:v1

``````
In a few seconds you have you results.
